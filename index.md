Welcome! I'm Brendan Francis O'Connor.

## Ham Radio Activities

### Getting Out OK

I usually operate [FT8](https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html), because my QTH ([CN87um](https://www.karhukoti.com/maidenhead-grid-square-locator/?grid=cn87um)) has somewhat problematic topology (I'm surrounded by biggish hills) and I'm in the middle of the city, so the noise floor isn't quite what it is in the middle of the woods.

I also operate while traveling in [The ShadyVan](https://twitter.com/theshadyvan) with my wife and cat, and there I use FT8, SSB, or whatever else seems like a good idea at the time. I've also done some [Parks on the Air](https://parksontheair.com/) here in the PNW, and intend to do much more in 2022, both as K3QB and K3QB/QRP.

My travel HF radio is a [Discovery TX-500](https://lab599.com/) that I use with a [SOTABeams Band Hopper IV](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/four-band-portable-dipole-antenna-system-band-hopper-iv/). At home, I have a Kenwood TS-50S that's currently not working, and a Yaesu FT-101EE that is working but for which I don't currently have a working microphone, and I use either an end-fed dipole or a 20m Double Bazooka antenna.

### ARRL

I'm an ARRL member, and have accepted an appointment as [ARRL Volunteer Counsel](http://www.arrl.org/locate-a-vc) for Washington (Northwest Division). I'm also barred in Montana, but only listed on their site under WA. I used to work with ARES teams all over the country, but I stopped working with Seattle ACS after [they demanded that all volunteers permanently waive attorney-client privilege](https://twitter.com/USSJoin/status/929468391504592897) as part of the Seattle Police Department's [extremely broad lawlessness](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-police-improperly-faked-radio-chatter-about-proud-boys-as-chop-formed-in-2020-investigation-finds/).
